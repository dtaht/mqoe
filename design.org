#+title: Design
* Some design thoughts

Presently polling all the queues at ever increasing sample rates has
a tendency to return a lot of data that has not changed.

Instead, possibly, we could just log
timestamp, hash, some_other_data, on every packet.

Tossing that into a ringbuffer, at 10Gbit, even with the smallest packets
is only 10000 entries per ms. Trivial, particularly because that could be per cpu.

This still leaves the existing netlink problem of trying to get
the full queue states back for further processing, where we cannot match on the x:y of the queue, but have to dump the whole thing. Still have to fix that!

However in the container case, is the container we are in visible?
that means we just trigger the poller on the qdiscs that have changed.
* Unified timebase remains desirable

Keeping track of everything in ns is kind of hard. TCP timestamps are at a ms resolution. Using floats has a precision of 2⁻23 which makes me a little nervous regarding ms vs ns. Have to think about it.

* prog action verb

I started off using getopt out of habit, but more modern programs like systemd and git dont work that way.

* math

I like using saturating math, in general. This requires work to coax from C, and less work from rust.
